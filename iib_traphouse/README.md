# esx_traphouse
This resource for ESX adds "trap houses" around the island for criminals to rob, based off of Jérémie N'gadi's [esx_holdup scipt](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_holdup). The criminals can earn money, black money, or any other items you want them to receive for a successful competion. Criminals cannot roam too far from the starting point or die during the robbery else it cancels.
